# Amazon-Clone
The Amazon Clone is a web-based project that replicates the key features and design of the Amazon online shopping platform using HTML and CSS. This clone focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive e-commerce interface, including a homepage with product listings, a search bar, and a navigation menu. The project aims to demonstrate the ability to build a structured and styled web page that mimics the look and feel of a major e-commerce site, providing a foundation for further development with JavaScript or backend integration.
